### ⚡ Research & Expertise
I specialize in high-resolution stochastic modeling and power system simulations. My current work focuses on bridging the gap between human behavior and grid stability.

* **CREST Model Implementation:** Developing 10-second resolution stochastic demand models to support **Dynamic Virtual Power Plant (DVPP)** testing in collaboration with researchers in Germany.
* **Stochastic Processes:** Utilizing **First-Order Markov Chains** for occupancy modeling and appliance activation probabilities.
* **Grid Stability:** Analyzing the "diversity effect" in aggregated household loads to test secondary frequency control.
