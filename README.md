### 👋 About Me
I am a senior engineering student and a research assistant.  
Currently, exploring the intersection of **Power Systems and Machine Learning**, specifically for load and PV radiation forecasting.  
As an RA, I develop high-resolution models to capture transients essential for validating **Dynamic Virtual Power Plant (DVPP)** controllers.


### 🚀 RA Work: [CREST Household Load Model](https://github.com/Umaru74/CREST_PY_74)
I have developed a Python-based stochastic engine to generate high-resolution synthetic load profiles for power system research.

* **Objective:** Developing granular demand data for **Dynamic Virtual Power Plant (DVPP)** controller testing.
* **Methodology:** Uses **First-Order Markov Chains** to simulate realistic household occupancy and appliance/lighting activation.
* **Granularity:** Upscaled to **10-second resolution** to capture high-frequency transients that impact grid frequency response.
* **Stack:** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-013243?style=flat-square&logo=numpy&logoColor=white) ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-150458?style=flat-square&logo=pandas&logoColor=white) ![Matplotlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Matplotlib-11557c?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white)

### ⚡ SMU PV Characterization Software: [SMU_PV_IV_Measurement](https://github.com/Umaru74/SMU_PV_IV_Measurement)

Developed a Python-based control and measurement system for thin-film photovoltaic characterization using a dual-channel Source Measure Unit (SMU).

- **Objective:** Accurate 4-wire electrical characterization of photovoltaic devices  
- **Hardware Integration:** USB/COM communication with SMU hardware  
- **Features:** Real-time GUI control, automated I–V sweep, hysteresis measurement, CSV export  
- **Validation:** Verified against commercial SMU software with identical I–V curves
