### ⚡ RA Work: DVPP Research
I am currently working as a **Research Assistant** on high-fidelity power system simulations. My work focuses on providing the granular data needed for modern grid control.

* **Objective:** Supporting **Dynamic Virtual Power Plant (DVPP)** controller testing.
* **Key Tasks:** Developing 10-second resolution demand models to capture high-frequency transients that standard 1-minute data misses.
* **Tools:** Validating models for use in **Opal-RT** (Real-Time Simulation) and **PSS®SINCAL** grid impact studies.

### 🚀 Personal Project: [CREST Household Load Model](https://github.com/Umaru74/CREST_PY_74)
This is a Python-based stochastic engine I am developing to generate high-resolution synthetic load profiles.

* **Methodology:** Uses **First-Order Markov Chains** to simulate realistic household occupancy and appliance activation.
* **Granularity:** Upscaled to **10-second resolution** to improve the accuracy of frequency response simulations.
* **Stack:** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-013243?style=flat-square&logo=numpy&logoColor=white) ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-150458?style=flat-square&logo=pandas&logoColor=white)
